# pands-weekly-tasks

## About
This repository contains weekly problem tasks for semester 1 of Programming and Scripting Module on Higher Data Analytics course offered by GMIT.
The purpose of these tasks was to creat

## Get Started
I used python to create the programs, and it can be installed by downloading [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
I also used a notebook editor which can be accessed through [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installation.

## List of Programs

## Programs
### 1.helloWorld.py
### 2.bank.py
### 3.accounts.py
### 4.collatz.py
### 5.weekday.py
### 6.es.py
### 7.squareroot.py
### 8.plottask.py

### Helloworld.py
This program displays "Hello World! when it is run

## Bank.py
This program prompts the user to enter two amount of money in cents.
Add the the two amounts and print it in Euro an cent amount.

Instruction:
    Enter amount1(in cent): 65
    Enter amount2(in cent): 180

Expected output:
    The sum of these is â‚¬2.45


## Accounts.py
This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs)
It is then modified to deal with account number

Instruction:
    Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
    Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length.

Expected output:
    XXXXXX7890


## Collatz.py
This program asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

At each step it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
More details about the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) can be found on wikipedia.

Instruction:
    Please enter a positive number: 10

Expected output:
    10 5 16 8 4 2 1


## Weekday.py
Program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

Output:
    If the program is run on a weekday it prints " Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday".
    If it's run on a weekend it prints out " It is the weekend yay!"

## Es.py


## Squareroot.py
This program creates a code that estimates a square root of a number by applying [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), if you want to avoid using the built in square root functions "x**o.5 or math.sqrt(x)".

Instruction:
    Please enter a positive number: 14.5

Expected output:
    The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.


## Plottask.py
This program displays a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on one set of axes.
